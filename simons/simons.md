# A4
- I had delete the whole directory and create a new one.
- In case when downloaded and android studio saying "Please select Android SDK", just edit something in "build.graddle" and restore back and it will notify to SYNC the whole project
- When open the project, select build.graddle from /app folder or /A4 folder, there will be a window pop up, simply close the window
